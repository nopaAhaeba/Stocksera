If you are wondering what other people think of Cars 2, you might be interested in reading some movie reviews. Cars 2 received mixed reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its animation, voice acting, and action scenes, but criticized its plot, humor, and characters. Some reviewers also felt that Cars 2 was too violent and dark for a family movie, and that it lacked the heart and charm of the original Cars.
  
Here are some examples of movie reviews for Cars 2:

> "Cars 2 is as visually appealing as any other Pixar production, but all that dazzle can't disguise the rusty storytelling under the hood." - Rotten Tomatoes[^1^]

> "While I was watching \"Cars 2,\" an elusive nostalgia tugged at my mind. No, I wasn't remembering Pixar's original \"Cars\" from 2006. This was something more deeply buried, and finally, in the middle of one of the movie's sensational grand prix races, it came to me: I was sitting on the floor of my bedroom many years ago, with some toy cars lined up in front of me, while I used my hands to race them around on the floor and in the air... In this memory, I was completely engrossed with my cars... I believe in some sense, the great animator was sitting Indian-style on the floor of his Pixar playroom and hurtling his cars through time and space with sublime reckless delight." - Roger Ebert[^2^]

> "Cars 2 is really a great movie it's not the first movie so even the third movie. But it still works really well. With a great cast story and score by Michael Guccanio." - IMDb user review[^3^]

> "Cars 2 suffers from a charmless and immoderately talky storyline that hikes up the thrills but forgets the widespread appeal of its far superior contemporaries." - Brandy McDonnell, The Oklahoman[^5^]

As you can see, Cars 2 has different opinions from different people. You might agree or disagree with some of these reviews, or you might have your own opinion after watching the movie. The important thing is to enjoy the movie for what it is: a fun and exciting adventure with your favorite cars.
