Bambang Trihatmodjo is the third child of former President Soeharto and Siti Hartinah. He was born on 23 July 1953 in Surakarta, Central Java. He completed his primary and secondary education in Jakarta, and then studied technical education at the Polytechnic Institute of Virginia in the United States.
 
Bambang, along with his two former school friends, Mochamad Tachril Sapi'ie and Rosano Barack, founded the massive Bimantara Citra group in 1981. The group had dozens of subsidiaries in various sectors, such as trade, insurance, real estate, television and communications, hotels, transport, agriculture, fisheries, automotive, food, chemical, and tourism. Bambang was also the founder of RCTI, the first private television station in Indonesia. He served as the director and commissioner of Bimantara Citra until 1998.
 
Bambang was also involved in politics as a member of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) from 1992 to 1998. He represented the Golkar Party, which was the ruling party during his father's regime. He was also the treasurer of Golkar's central board.
  
After his father stepped down from power in 1998, Bambang faced legal troubles and public scrutiny over his business empire. He was accused of corruption, collusion and nepotism, and was ordered to return some of his assets to the state. He was also banned from travelling abroad by the Attorney General's Office. Bambang denied any wrongdoing and claimed that he built his business through hard work and innovation.

Bambang is known as a low-profile and humble person, who rarely gives interviews or makes public appearances. He once said: "I don't like to talk about myself. I prefer to let my actions speak for themselves." He also said that he learned a lot from his father, especially about leadership and discipline. He said: "My father taught me to be responsible for my decisions and actions. He also taught me to respect others and to be grateful for what I have."
