x360ce is a popular software that allows you to use any controller (gamepad, joystick, wheel, etc.) as an Xbox 360 controller on your PC. This can be useful for playing games that do not support your controller natively, such as Grand Theft Auto or Mafia II.
 
x360ce vibmod 3.1.0.4 beta3.zip.30 is a modified version of x360ce that includes some additional features and fixes, such as vibration support, improved compatibility, and bug fixes. You can download it from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/x360ce/files/x360ce%20vibmod%203.1.4.1.zip/download) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6DZFPfjUxJKQ28tX1hQMXVpd1E/view). Note that this version is not officially supported by the x360ce developers, so use it at your own risk.
