## The Highlights of Goku vs Frieza
 
The fight between Goku and Frieza is widely regarded as one of the best and longest fights in anime history. It showcases the incredible power and determination of both characters, as well as their contrasting personalities and motivations. Here are some of the highlights of this fight:
 
- The first encounter: Goku arrives on Namek after recovering from his injuries on Earth. He senses Frieza's evil ki and rushes to confront him. He easily defeats Frieza's henchmen and challenges him to a one-on-one fight. Frieza accepts, confident that he can crush Goku with his overwhelming power.
- The Super Saiyan transformation: After witnessing Frieza kill his best friend Krillin, Goku is overcome with rage and grief. He unleashes his hidden potential and transforms into a Super Saiyan for the first time, shocking Frieza and everyone else. He vows to avenge his fallen friends and defeat Frieza once and for all.
- The final clash: After a long and brutal fight, Goku and Frieza are both exhausted and injured. Goku decides to end the fight with a massive Spirit Bomb, gathering energy from all living beings in the universe. He launches it at Frieza, who tries to counter it with his own energy blast. The two attacks collide in a spectacular explosion that seems to destroy Frieza.
- The surprise attack: However, Frieza survives the Spirit Bomb and emerges from the rubble. He shoots a death beam at Goku's ally Piccolo, critically wounding him. He then tries to kill Goku's son Gohan, who rushes to help Piccolo. Goku intervenes and takes the hit instead, saving Gohan's life. Enraged by Frieza's cowardice, Goku decides to spare him and give him some of his energy, hoping that he will change his ways.
- The final blow: However, Frieza refuses to accept Goku's mercy and tries to kill him with another death beam. Goku dodges it and fires a powerful Kamehameha wave at Frieza, slicing him in half. He tells Frieza that he has no hope of winning and that he should have taken his offer. He then flies away, leaving Frieza to die on the exploding planet.
