1. Insert two AA alkaline batteries (not included) into the battery compartment at the end of the level. Make sure to align the polarity correctly.
2. Turn on the level by pressing and holding the power button for two seconds. The display will show the current angle in degrees.
3. Place the level on the surface you want to measure. The display will automatically rotate to show the correct orientation. You can also use the surface grippers and precision milled edges to ensure a stable and accurate placement.
4. Press the unit button to change the display units. You can choose from degrees (Â°), slope (%), pitch (IN/FT) or mm/m. The pitch will show a plus (+) or minus (-) sign depending on the direction of the slope.
5. Press and hold the zero button to calibrate the level to any reference angle. The display will show 0.0Â° and beep. You can then measure the relative angle from that point.
6. Press and hold the laser button to turn on the laser beam. You can use it to project a horizontal or vertical line for alignment purposes. Press the laser button again to turn it off.
7. Press and hold the power button for two seconds to turn off the level. The level will also automatically shut off after five minutes of inactivity.
