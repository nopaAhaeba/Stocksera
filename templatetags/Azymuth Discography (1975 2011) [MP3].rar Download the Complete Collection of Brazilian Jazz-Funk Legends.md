## The Early Years: AzimÃ¼th (1975) and Ãguia NÃ£o Come Mosca (1977)
 
The original lineup of Azymuth consisted of JosÃ© Roberto Bertrami on keyboards, Alex Malheiros on bass and guitars, and Ivan Conti on drums and percussion. They started out as a cover band called Grupo SeleÃ§Ã£o in the early 1970s, but changed their name to Azymuth in 1973, inspired by a song by Marcos Valle. They also backed Valle on his album PrevisÃ£o Do Tempo, released in the same year.
 
In 1975, they released their debut album, initially titled AzimÃ¼th. It featured the hit Linha Do Horizonte, which became the theme song for a popular soap opera. The album showcased their innovative fusion of Brazilian rhythms and electronic sounds, influenced by artists such as Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea and Weather Report.
 
In 1977, they followed up with Ãguia NÃ£o Come Mosca (Eagles Don't Eat Flies), which further developed their style and introduced elements of funk and disco. The album included tracks such as Tamborim CuÃ­ca Ganza Berimbau, VÃ´o Sobre O Horizonte and A Presa.
 
## The International Breakthrough: Light As A Feather (1979) and Outubro (1980)
 
In 1979, Azymuth signed with Milestone Records, an American label that specialized in jazz. They released Light As A Feather, which became their most successful album to date. It contained Jazz Carnival, a track that combined a catchy samba groove with a synth melody and a saxophone solo. Jazz Carnival became a worldwide hit, reaching number 19 in the UK Singles Chart and number one in several countries. It also became a staple of dance clubs and radio stations.
 
Light As A Feather also featured other memorable tracks such as Partido Alto, Fly Over The Horizon and Amazonia. The album received critical acclaim for its originality and sophistication, and established Azymuth as one of the leading jazz-funk groups of the era.
 
In 1980, they released Outubro (October), which continued their winning streak. The album included Dear Limmertz, another hit single that showcased Bertrami's virtuosic keyboard skills. It also featured tracks such as Papasong, Maracana and Un Amigo.

## The Later Years: Far Out Recordings (1995-2011)
 
After releasing several more albums for Milestone Records in the 1980s, Azymuth went through some changes in the 1990s. Bertrami left the group in 1988 and was replaced by Jota Moraes and Marinho Boffa for two albums. He returned in the mid-1990s, when the group signed with Far Out Recordings, a London-based label that specialized in Brazilian music.
 
With Far Out Recordings, Azymuth entered a new phase of their career. They revisited some of their classic tracks with new arrangements and guests, such as Carnival (1996), which featured remixes by artists such as Jazzanova and Roni Size. They also experimented with new sounds and influences, such as drum'n'bass, hip hop and electronica.
 
Some of their notable albums from this period include Pieces Of Ipanema (1998), Before We Forget (2000), Brazilian Soul (2004), Butterfly (2008) and Aurora (2011). They also collaborated with German saxophonist JÃ¼rgen Seefelder on Impulse! (2007) and
