Do Not Feed the Monkeys is a digital voyeur simulator where you watch strangers through surveillance cameras and compromised webcams. You are a member of the Primate Observation Club, a shadowy group that observes other people's lives and analyzes the information obtained. But there is one rule you must never break: do not feed the monkeys, that is, do not interact or interfere with the subjects in any way.
 
The game was released in 2018 by Fictiorama Studios and BadLand Games Publishing S.L., and has received very positive reviews from players and critics alike. The game offers a unique blend of point-and-click, management, simulation, and 2D graphics, as well as a dark and twisted humor. The game also features multiple endings and branching paths depending on your choices and actions.
